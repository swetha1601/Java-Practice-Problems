Coffee Vending Machine

Behavioural Pattern

1. State pattern
states
The State Pattern is useful in modeling the coffee vending machine's behavior, where the machine operates in different states.
The states could include: idle,brewing coffee, dispensing the coffee




2. Factory Method Pattern
types
The Factory Method Pattern can be used to create different types of coffee based on the user's selection (e.g., espresso, cappuccino).
The factory method can instantiate different types of drinks without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

3. Observer Pattern
notif
The Observer Pattern is ideal for handling notifications, such as when the machine is low on ingredients (e.g., coffee beans, milk). 
Observers (such as an alert system or maintenance team) can subscribe to changes in the machine's status and be notified when maintenance is needed.

4. Command Pattern
The Command Pattern allows you to encapsulate requests (e.g., selecting coffee, inserting coins, brewing coffee) as objects.
This can be useful when the coffee vending machine needs to queue commands or undo certain actions (like canceling a selection).
